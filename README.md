This is NXcustom

While the main branch should work well currently (if you are cloning), there have been some significant
changes and we are still working to document those. Also know that until we officially
post the latest release to the Siemens community site, git history may be rewritten.
It is still being decided whether we will use Github flow, Git flow, or something between.
Continous release will be a priority. More info to come soon!

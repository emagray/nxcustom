NXcustom Reuse Library                                    Last Modified: 19Dec2019

Use the Reuse folder to share the Reuse Library with multiple users.

To set up a centralized Reuse Library in NXcustom, do the following:

1) Place folders, part files and KRX files in the NXcustom\NXxxxxlibrary\Reuse folder

2) The Reuse Library location is controlled by Customer Defaults.
You can access the Customer Defaults from File > Utilities> Customer Defaults > Gateway > Reuse Library

Edit the following line in the Libraries Organized by Native Folder field to add or change the library name:

My Reuse Library|${NXCUSTOM_LIB}/Reuse

NXcustom CMMresource                                    Last Modified: 18May2021

Use the CMMresource folder to share the MACH\resource folder with multiple users.

To set up a centralized CMMresource folder in NXcustom, do the following:

Copy ONLY the sub folders of ...\NX\MACH\resource folder to CMMresource that contain changes relative to the Out of the Box folders

Any folder that is found in the CMMresource folder will automatically be included in the environment like templates, libraries, cmm's, etc.
All missing folders will come from the installation folder of NX.

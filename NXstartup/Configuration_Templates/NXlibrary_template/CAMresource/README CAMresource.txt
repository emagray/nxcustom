NXcustom CAMresource                                    Last Modified: 8Jan2020

Use the CAMresource folder to share the MACH\resource folder with multiple users.

To set up a centralized CAMresource folder in NXcustom, do the following:

Copy ONLY the sub folders of ...\NX\MACH\resource folder to CAMresource that contain changes relative to the Out of the Box folders

Any folder that is found in the CAMresource folder will automatically be included in the environment like posts, templates, tool libraries, machine tool kits, etc.
All missing folders will come from the installation folder of NX.

This location is where configuration files should be stored. NXstart.conf, NX_paths.conf, and all TCenv_xxxx.conf files should be stored here.

This location was created to remove configuration from the NXstartup folder, so the NXstartup folder and its contents could be easily replaced
during an update of NXcustom.
